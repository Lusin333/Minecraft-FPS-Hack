## History
Lusin HATES lagging in Minecraft!!!

Long ago, Lusin had a bad computer.  The computer was so slow and couldn't even run Minecraft at a good FPS (60fps bare minimum).  Everyone in Minecraft insulted Lusin for having such a low FPS, they called Lusin a ***"filthy casual"*** and to ***"go back to playing MineSWEEPER, you noob!"***

Lusin had to do something to gain the respect Lusin deserves within the Minecraft community.  After many weeks of hacking and programming, Lusin finally created the Minecraft FPS Hack!
